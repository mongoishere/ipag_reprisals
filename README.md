# ipag_reprisals
Was sick of feeling like a script kiddie, so I made my own IP Puller for Xbox called "Internet Protocol Address Grabber" and the name of my clan on H5.

If you do not know how to use or configure...don't use it.

## Installation

Nothing too complicated here, just `git clone https://github.com/mongoishere/ipag_reprisals` and make the appropriate adjustments. There are some requriments needed for IPAG_Reprisal to work properly which can be viewed in the requirments.txt file. To install these requirments use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to Use

After cloning the repository navigate to the ipag_reprisal directory `cd ipag_reprisals/` start IPAG Reprisal with `python ipag_reprisal.py`. You should see a menu that allows you to navigate between sub-menus. It is important to allow for IP Forwarding before starting the sniffing process. Make sure that you configure the Target Xbox IP value to point to your Xbox's Address on the LAN.
