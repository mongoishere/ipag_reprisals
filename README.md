## Installation

Nothing too complicated here, just `git clone https://github.com/mongoishere/ipag_reprisals` and make the appropriate adjustments. There are some requriments needed for IPAG_Reprisal to work properly which can be viewed in the requirments.txt file. To install these requirments use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
